    <h2>Baked Chicken Tacos</h2>
    <p>This quick and simple recipe is one of our favorites.</p>
    <p>It isn't difficult to make, and it takes minimal time and effort!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 pound cooked chicken</li>
    <li>1 ounce Taco Seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 cup onion</li>
    <li>1 can diced tomato</li>
    <li>1 can Chopped Green Chiles</li>
    <li>10 Stand and Stuff Taco Shells</li>
    <li>8 ounces Refried Beans</li>
    <li>2 cups Mexican Blend Cheese</li>
    <li>Toppings such as Old El Paso sliced Jalapenos, sour cream, salsa, chopped cilantro, shredded lettuce, or any of your favorite taco toppings!</li>


</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 400F. Spray a 9Ã—13 baking dish with nonstick spray</li>
<li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a medium skillet</li>
<li>Add onion to skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent and fragrant</li>
<li>Stir in the chicken, taco seasoning, tomatoes (FULLY DRAINED), and green chiles (FULLY  DRAINED) *see note. Stir to combine fully. Reduce to simmer and allow to cook for 5-8 minutes</li>
<li>Place the taco shells in the baking dish, standing up. I was able to fit 10 taco shells in the dish by adding 2 on each side</li>
<li>Bake the taco shells for 5 minutes by themselves to allow them to crisp up. Remove from the oven</li>
<li>Spoon 1 tablespoon of beans into the bottom of each taco shell. Top with the chicken mixture, almost to the top of each shell</li>
<li>Sprinkle each shell generously with shredded cheese, the more the better</li>
<li>Bake for 7-10 minutes or until cheese is fully melted and the edges of the shells are browned</li>
<li>Remove from the oven and top with your favorite items such as jalapenos, sour cream, cilantro, and salsa</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
